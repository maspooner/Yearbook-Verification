First, type a list of names into input.xlsx that are considered valid name combinations.
Run the program and click "Reload Name Database." This will have to be clicked each time a change is made to input.xlsx.

On the right, spelling errors and unknown names are shown, and the input on the left is formatted.
Fix the spelling errors on the left, click "Verify" once more.
If there are no more errors, the text on the left is spell checked and ready to be put in the yearbook.
